Adds geographic location and weather support to WordPress.

## Description ##

Supports adding geo coordinates, a location taxonomy, and a textual location description to a post, comment, user, or attachment. Supports adding weather data to a post or to a widget based on location.
Offers choice of map displays. It supports retrieving location using the HTML5 geolocation API by default. Clicking the location icon or 'Lookup Location' will retrieve the location. 

As it stores the GeoData in the classic WordPress format, Geodata can also be added from other plugins.

Automatically saves location data from image metadata when uploaded as well.

Offers the opportunity to change the displayed timezone on a per-post basis for those posts from far off locations and set this based on the coordinates of the location. 
While Gutenberg compatible, this is not built for Gutenberg.

## Privacy and Data Notice ##

Simple Location stores location and weather data inside posts, attachments, comments, and term meta...optionally other post types. This data respects a public, private or 
protected setting. Attachment data is automatically extracted from images if location is present, which could be extracted by any third-party downloading the picture
unless removed. For all other data, it is provided by the user, who decides its ultimate use. Location data is made available through a geolocation provider...the default is currently
HTML5 browser geolocation, for which the user must give consent to share). Other information is secured through use of third-party APIs to identify a 
location, calculate elevation, display maps, and weather conditions.

## Locations and Venues ##

Locations uses WordPress taxonomies to allow you to generate an archive page of all posts from that location and giving it a permalink on your site. Locations are meant to reflect a more general
location...for example, "Here are posts I made in California." 

Locations are divided by administrative areas. The hierarchy for locations is:
* Country
* Region - state, county, or province level. 
* Locality - city, town, or village level

You can choose to display the location over the textual address field. There is an option in settings to change this behavior.

The reverse geocoding system attempts to consistently retrieve the country code, region code, and locality for the location and add them to the location taxonomy. This can be potentially problematic, as if the returns
from the locations added aren't consistent, it will duplicate and explode the list of terms. This is the same issue that has held back venues.

Locations are matched using the country code, region code, and locality field, and therefore, you can edit the displayed name or the region code without issue. Due to matching issues, you may have to make some manual changes and there may be some occasional duplication.

There is no top level Location page, /location included in the plugin. You can create a page at this location and use a custom template to allow it to show a list of your locations. 

Venues are meant to reflect a specific location, such as a business or point of interest. Venues were originally set up as a taxonomy, and were in the plugin unimplemented for several versions. However,
due to various changes since that was set up, they were switched to a custom post type. Under this setup, each venue is represented by a URL on the site that posts can be linked to. The URL contains
information about the venue.

## Zones ##

Zones allow for geofencing. You can set coordinates and a radius around them. If you set location to a place within a zone, the default behavior is to replace the location
with a preset Name and hide the coordinates. This allows you to protect private locations such as your home, or your place of business. For Micropub, it will set the location
as protected if the location is in the zone and the location-visibility property is not set. For the post editor in WordPress, looking up the location of an item inside the 
zone will result in the visibility being set to protected and the name being set to the zone name. This can be overridden.

Zones are replaced as of 5.0.0 with Private Venues

## Weather ##

Weather consists of at minimum the current conditions and temperature but includes future parameters for use such as pressure, wind speed, wind direction degree, etc. Weather widgets are available 
that can be set to a specific location, a user, station ID, or airport code. Station ID is available from supported providers for weather stations, for example from a Personal Weather Station(PWS).

## Stations ##

Stations allow for using a custom data source for weather data. This source should be a URL that returns a JSON object. When using the Custom Station provider for weather, it 
will look for when one of the stations defined is within 10km of your current location. It will then use the return as the current weather conditions. Please note that the
return must be in the format documented in the code. 

## WordPress GeoData ##

[WordPress Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) is an existing standardized way to store geodata about a post, user, comment, or term.

It consists of four fields: latitude, longitude, public, and address. This matches up with the HTML5 Geolocation fields. The [W3C Geolocation Specification](https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) 
also provides for properties of altitude, accuracy, altitudeAccuracy, speed, and heading, which may be stored. Map Zoom is also stored as a geodata property.

Timezone is also stored as a property and is derived from the location by default or set manually.

In order to access private location information, the following custom capabilities are added to WordPress:
* 'read_{$object_type}_location' - Whether or not a user is allowed to read information locations for object types: posts, comments, terms, users. A user is always allowed to read the location from their objects.
* 'edit_{$object_type}_location' - Whether or not a user is allowed to edit information locations for object types: posts, comments, terms, users. A user is always allowed to read the location from their objects.


## Providers ##

The plugin is designed to be extensible and anyone could write a plugin that would add additional providers.

* Map Providers are services that offer an API to retrieve maps, which are displayed on posts with a location. Providers include MapBox, Google, Mapquest, HERE, LocationIQ, Geoapify, TomTom, and Bing.
* Geocoding Providers take geo coordinates and look up the actual location/address for textual display. Geocoding Providers include Nominatim, HERE, the Mapquest hosted version of Nominatim, Google, Bing, LocationIQ, OpenRoute and Geonames. They also support looking up coordinate for physical addresses
* Venue providers, similar to Geocoding providers, search for locations from coordinates, however, instead of returning street addresses, or municipality, it returns a list of places or venues.
* Elevation Providers optionally derive the elevation from an API when not available. Elevation is used to estimate altitude and adjust estimated sunrise/sunset levels accordingly.
* Location Providers attempt to determine your location to add it to a post. Providers include  HTML5 Browser Geolocation, a Provider that takes the location setting out of the author profile, a provider that returns the exact
location of a three letter airport code, and [Compass](https://github.com/aaronpk/Compass), a self-hosted option for storing your location.
* Weather Providers retrieve weather data about your location and include OpenWeatherMap, Pirate Weather, Dark Sky, Weatherstack, WeatherBit, HERE and the US National Weather Service. HERE, Pirate Weather, Dark Sky, WeatherBit, and Weatherstack do not support stations. There is also an option for custom station URLs that must return the properties as they are stored in WordPress.
** The National Weather Service(US) uses their station lookup API to find the closest weather station, and uses weather from there. Therefore, if this returns no options, if you are outside the US, it will return no weather.
** The Met Office(UK) uses the distance from your current location to the nearest UK weather station and finds the closest one. However, if the nearest station is more than 100km away, it will return nothing.
** For Weather services like the NWS, Met Office, and the Custom Provider, where coverage is not worldwide, if nothing is found, a fallback provider can be set and used.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What are the requirements to use this plugin? ###

API Keys are required to use certain services.
* [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/) - To retrieve style list inside the UI, you need a token with the styles:list scope
* [Bing](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/)
* [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.com/api)
* [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/)
* [HERE](https://developer.here.com/)
* [Compass](https://github.com/aaronpk/Compass)
* [Weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com)
* [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current)
* [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org) - requires a username
* [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/)
* [Met Office UK](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint)
* [OpenRoute Service](https://openrouteservice.org/)
* [GeoApify](https://geoapify.com)
* [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/)
* [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/) 
* [Pirate Weather](https://pirateweather.net)
* [TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com/)
* [AerisWeather](https://aerisweather.com/) - Individuals who share their personal weather station data with PWSWeather.com are offered a free contributor account.

At this time, all map services require an API key, but most permit limited non-commercial use.
Nominatim does not require an API key, but it does ask for an email address, which will be the admin email of the site
If not provided there will be no map displayed regardless of setting, reverse geo lookup will not work 
Without a weather provider this service will not work. 

API Keys may have free limits, or may incur fees if overused. This plugin only uses a request when you post, which is usually well within the free tier which is usually thousands of requests. In all cases, you must comply 
with the provider's terms of use.

The appropriate API keys should be entered in Settings->Simple Location or will move to Indieweb->Location if the Indieweb plugin if installed.

### How do I add support for location to a custom post type? ###

`add_post_type_support( 'geo-location');` 
`add_post_type_support( 'weather' );`

The software uses two custom features to declare that the post type supports these features, otherwise the location and weather features do not show in the editor.

### Why are my maps served from the provider instead of saved as images to my site? ###

The terms of service of most map providers expressly forbid this. While the likelihood of one of these providers coming after an individual is slim, this would be a violation of WordPress plugin guidelines.
This is why the plugin does not save maps to the media library. The only self-serve option being offered at this time is to self-host a caching static map API endpoint.

### What is the custom map provider? ###

The custom map provider is an endpoint you provide yourself. You can install and use the repository [here](https://github.com/dshanske/Static-Maps-API-PHP), which is a fork of a project by [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com).
The custom provider was designed around the parameters in this code. All the commercial static map APIs used assemble the pieces of a map from public tile servers, which
is what this code does. While the code allows for multiple tile sources, please ensure compliance with their licenses. At the least, most of them require attribution. 

### What is the custom weather provider? ###

This allows you to use a custom endpoint that returns current weather conditions in json, using the property names used by this plugin, which can be found outlined in the class-weather-provider.php file. The configuration for this
takes a URL and an ID. So you could run a script that generates a static page anywhere from any source with this data.

### Which providers support historic weather data? ###

Currently, only Visual Crossing supports historic weather data on their basic plan. Meteostat consists solely of historical data and has no current data.

### What is the fallback weather provider? ###

Several providers, including the custom provider, the National Weather Service(US), and the Met Office(UK) only provide limited locations for retrieving weather data. This specifies where to look if the first provider fails.
This may be replaced with better logic in future.

### Is this compatible with the WordPress mobile apps? ###

Simple Location uses WordPress Geodata to store location, as does the WordPress app. So setting location with the app should allow it to be displayed by Simple Location. The only major difference
is that whether or not a location is public is set with either 0 for private or 1 for public. The spec implemented states a non-zero number is considered public. This plugin adds the option of 2,
also known as protected, which shows a textual description of the location but does not display a map or geographic coordinates.

However, now that the WordPress apps no longer support location, this may be moot. 

### The Location Icon does not retrieve my location. ###

Chrome Users: Retrieves the location using the HTML5 geolocation API(available in your browser) will not work on Chrome if your website is not secure(https). This is a Chrome decision to ensure safe control of personal data.

You can take advantage of the other built-in location providers, for example, one uses the location of the user or create your own location provider as a separate plugin.

### How can I update the location of my user profile? ###

You can do so under your user profile or alternatively update using a REST API endpoint. By posting to `/wp-json/sloc_geo/1.0/user` with the latitude, longitude, altitude parameters, or with a geojson body, will
update the user associated with the credentials you provide to the REST API.

### How can I access the location or weather data on the frontend? ###

There are REST API endpoints to retrieve the data so it can be used in the admin under the namespace `/wp-json/sloc_geo/1.0`:
* /timezone which will return timezone data for a latitude/longitude or airport code
* /weather which will return the weather for a latitude/longitude or station ID
* /geocode which will return the address information for a latitude/longitude and optionally add the weather
* /lookup which will return the current location for a user based on the location provider
* /airport allows search for an airport by IATA code, ICAO code, or Municipality. Used for the airport location search
* /map which will return static map data for the provided latitude and longitude

### What is Compass? ###

[Compass](https://github.com/aaronpk/Compass) is a GPS tracking server that stores data in flat files. The instructions for installation are available in the GitHub repository. GPS
data can be sent to it from iOS or Android devices using various apps.

### How can I show a list of posts tagged with a location? ###

You can filter any query or archive by adding `?geo={all|public|text}` to it to show only public posts with location. Adding /geo/all to the homepage or archive pages should also work

### How can I see a map of all the locations in an archive page? ###

If you add /map to any archive URL, for example, example.com/2019/map it will return a template with a map view of that archive. It uses a default template built into the theme.
Being as styling this would not be customized to your theme, you can add a map-archive.php file to your theme to customize this. For taxonomies, use /map/taxonomy/term.

### JetPack offers Location Display, why do I need this? ###

JetPack only began offering location display in 2017, 3 years after this plugin was created. This plugin disables their implementation as it created conflicts.

They do not offer the features this plugin does and their goal is a minimal implementation.

### Why am I seeing location on private posts with the notation Hidden? ###

This appears to users who can read private posts when logged in. It does not appear when not logged in. The same applies to the location taxonomy. If you are not logged in, or 
are logged in and don't have the read_private_posts permission, you won't see posts with private locations. 

### How can I report issues or request support? ###

The Development Version as well as support can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/simple-location).

### How can I add support for ___ ? ###

Simple Location has the concept of Providers. Providers are an abstract class that you can implement to take information from one format into the one Simple Location understands.
The plugin offers providers for:
* Geolocation - Looking up an address from coordinates or vice versa
* Location - By default this uses your browser to lookup your location but you can alternatively tap into a service to get your current location, perhaps from your phone
* Weather - Retrieves weather based on location or station ID
* Map - Provides maps for display

### What icons are used here? ###

* [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) are used for most of the weather options.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used for the transportation icons.
* [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) supplies the transportation brand icons.

## Upgrade Notice ##

### 5.0.0 ###

Due to extensive refactoring in this version, there may be unanticipated behavior. Old functions have been removed and users calling them directly may need to 
New global functions have been introduced to reduce the calls to specific classes. Weather and location data has been separated into separate storage locations and functions, with a new
signature based on the Metadata API. This means that rolling back once the data is migrated could be problematic and the recommendation is to backup before upgrading.

Venues are introduced officially. They replace the Zone feature and will be expanded to additional functionality in future. They should be considered a beta feature at this point. 

The ability to set location taxonomy to display over address is currently global. Will be looking for better control in future.

### 4.4.0 ###

This update includes support for Locations. Which will be generated when a new location is looked up.

### 4.1.5 ###

Wikimedia Maps has turned off third-party access and advised they have no plans to return it. So this service is now removed. Added some new services to cover.

### 4.1.0 ###

Dark Sky has been acquired by Apple and no longer permits you to apply for an API key. If you already have one, the functionality in this plugin will work, according to them, until end of 2021 after
which it will be removed from this plugin. The plugin offers several other weather providers. The Met Office weather plugin has not been tested in live use as the developer is not in the UK. It
is also not as detailed as some of the other options in what data it provides.

### 4.0.0 ###

The Compass API/URL information is now stored in the user profile. When publishing, it will pull this information in from the current logged in user. This was previously stored globally. When using UTC offsets over
timezone strings, only systems running PHP5.5 and above will work correctly. Default height for maps has been replaced by aspect ratio.

### 3.7.0 ###

This upgrade cleans up some possibly old data in the database when you load the settings page for the plugin. If you have a lot of posts, the load may be slow initially.

### 3.4.0 ###

Hardcoded and filtered options for new providers have been replaced by a provider registration function with the strings and slug for the provider set inside the provider itself.

### 3.0.0 ###

Recommend backup before upgrade to Version 3.0.0 due to the start of venue support. Full location data will not be saved in the post and old posts will be converted. The display name will be saved if set, otherwise a display name will be set from the coordinates. An API key
will now be required to show maps for services that require API keys.
